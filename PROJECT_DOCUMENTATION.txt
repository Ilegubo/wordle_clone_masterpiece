PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
=====================

1. Executive Summary
--------------------
This project is a Word Guessing Game implemented in Python using the Flet framework. It provides an interactive interface for users to guess words, similar to popular word puzzle games, with both on-screen and physical keyboard support.

2. Project Objectives
---------------------
- Develop an engaging and interactive word guessing game.
- Support both on-screen and physical keyboard inputs.
- Provide visual feedback for correct, misplaced, and incorrect letters.
- Allow users to select word length and theme.
- Ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

3. Project Scope
----------------
- Single-player word guessing game.
- Customizable themes and word lengths.
- No multiplayer or online features.
- No persistent user data storage.

4. Project Guidelines
---------------------
- Use Python and Flet for UI and logic.
- Follow best practices for code readability and modularity.
- Provide clear visual cues for game status and letter correctness.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux).

5. System Overview
------------------
- The game randomly selects a word from a local or downloaded word list.
- Users guess the word by entering letters via the on-screen or physical keyboard.
- The game provides color and formatting hints for each letter:
  - Uppercase: correct letter in correct position
  - Lowercase: correct letter in wrong position
  - Crossed-out lowercase: letter not in the word
- The interface is split: keyboard on the left, game board and status on the right.

6. Source Code
--------------
See `word_game.py` for the full source code. Key components:
- `WordGuessingGame` class: main game logic and UI
- Methods for game setup, input handling, UI updates, and feedback
- Event handlers for keyboard and button actions

7. Dependencies Imported
------------------------
- flet
- random
- requests
- os
- typing (List, Dict, Optional)

8. Special Permissions Required
------------------------------
- Internet access (to download word list if not present)
- File system access (to read/write `words.txt`)

9. Proposed Database System
--------------------------
- No database system is used or required. All data is stored in local text files (`words.txt`).
